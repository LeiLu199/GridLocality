# Project Name: GridLocality
This project is to construct a grid object and perform some tasks including node information retrieval, neighbor search, and similarity comparison.

## Author: Lei Lu

### Usage of the Modules:
This repository contains three modules:

  - GridLocality.py
  - helper.py
  - main.py

1) GridLocality.py
> This module contains two classes: 1) Node and 2) Grid.

> 1) The Node class was initialized with 4 attributes *x*, *y*, *i* and *v*, where 
   
   > - integer x: the x coordinate of the node in the grid
   > - integer y: the y coordinate of the node at the grid
   > - integer i: the index of the node, representing the order of node being created in the grid
   > - vector v: a random vector of dimension *n*




> 2) The Grid class was instantiated with 2 parameters *n* and *stdout*, where 

   
   > - integer n: the length of a *n* by *n* grid.
   > - Boolean stdout: 



Under the class Node, there are six functions define:
